# Emotify: Emotion Detection and Music Recommendation

## Description

This project is an application that detects a user's emotions from their facial expressions and recommends music based on their expression. The system processes webcam images to identify emotions and uses Spotify's API to play songs that match the detected emotion.

## Overview of System Architecture

This system consists of three interconnected components:

- **Machine Learning Client** - Captures webcam images, detects facial emotions using DeepFace, and requests matching songs from Spotify's API.
- **Web Application** - A Flask-based frontend that lets users capture images, trigger emotion detection, and view their emotion history with recommended songs.
- **MongoDB Database** - Stores emotion detection history and song recommendations for user tracking and review.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- Python 3.11+
- MongoDB
- Spotify Developer Account (for API access)
